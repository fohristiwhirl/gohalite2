TODO (IMPORTANT)

- Leave the GA alone

- Better bad-combat-avoidance (not based on own target??)
- Threat detection for planets based on.. what each ship's closest interesting planet is??
- Psyho Strategy: target docked ships only, falling back if needed.

TODO (SOMEWHAT)

-

OTHER

- 10 should be 11 in the ExecuteSafely() loop
- Make genetic algo disallow events where we have 0 ships and enemy has >= 1
- There are some minor issues in the messaging system to do with e.g. SlowPlanDown() being called, followed by a a new course getting set due to deactivation of something.
