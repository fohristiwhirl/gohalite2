TODO

- Better Angle Messaging.
- Choose which way we dodge while navigating (in collision.go) based on angle(us, final-target) and its first planet collision.
------ (Make sure not to use a ship collision.)
- When trying to execute a move with ATC, sort the ships somehow in order of most-likely-to-succeed.
- Docking is OK for a few ships (select them somehow) if we have overwhelming force.
- Maybe use our ship IDs to decide whether we are needed, if there are a lot more friendlies present.
- Perhaps our ship's stored target should always be a planet for simplicity?
- 1v1 improvements.

Allocation idea:
- Make a list of targets.
- Each target requires some number of ships allocated to it.
- Every time we send a ship, lower the requirement count.
- (Maybe increase the requirement count if the ship going is lost.)
- If something ceases to be a target, deallocate whatever's going to it.
