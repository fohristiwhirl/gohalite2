TODO

- Maybe start with closest planet and *its* closest planet?
- Distress calls / target overrides.
- On turn 1, is the enemy coming for me? If yes, go aggro. If no, land...
- Or alternatively, if the other player flees, take the centre planets?
- Should use does_collide() for perfect ATC.
- When trying to execute a move with ATC, sort the ships somehow in order of most-likely-to-succeed.
- Docking is OK for a few ships (select them somehow) if we have overwhelming force.
- Maybe use our ship IDs to decide whether we are needed, if there are a lot more friendlies present.
- 1v1 improvements.
- Shummie's 2nd place shennanigans?


1v1 note:
- If the lead ship can close fast enough, it can both absorb all the shots and collide with an enemy (which is good).
- i.e. the enemy will waste their shots. Hopefully our ships don't waste theirs.
- The distances need to be right. All of the above needs to happen in 1 turn.
- It very much relies on the enemy closing with us. If the enemy sits still we won't collide.

Allocation idea:
- Make a list of targets.
- Each target requires some number of ships allocated to it.
- Every time we send a ship, lower the requirement count.
- (Maybe increase the requirement count if the ship going is lost.)
- If something ceases to be a target, deallocate whatever's going to it.

1v1 autowin detection:
- Certain scenarios are autowins in 1v1. Detect them and act accordingly.
------ e.g. if we can send a healthy ship to hunt down the last enemy, while a 2nd ship farms.
