TODO (IMPORTANT)

- Whole board GA? Relevant ships are: any of my ships within 20 of an enemy, those same enemies, and any ship within 8 of my mutable ships (set these to non-mutable).

- The decision to switch into rush needs to use enemy ships centre of gravity? Not general centre of gravity?

VAGUE IDEAS

- Better bad-combat-avoidance (not based on own target??)
- Threat detection for planets based on.. what each ship's closest interesting planet is??
- Psyho Strategy: target docked ships only, falling back if needed.



TODO (SOMEWHAT)

-



OTHER

- Make genetic algo disallow events where we have 0 ships and enemy has >= 1
