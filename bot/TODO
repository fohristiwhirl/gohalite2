TODO (IMPORTANT)

- Deal with rushes in 4 player...
- Fix 2v1 check for 4p case.

TODO (SOMEWHAT)

- Implement the "twelve" concept for not penalising 2 hits of 13 so much?
- Better bad-combat-avoidance (not based on own target??)

OTHER

- Make genetic algo disallow events where we have 0 ships and enemy has >= 1
- Intentional reckless (i.e. ramming) behaviour when a ship is low health
- 10 should be 11 in the ExecuteSafely() loop

ALTERNATIVE GENETIC REWARD FUNCTION...

- Perhaps try and get all ships to a place where exactly 1 enemy can reach them...
