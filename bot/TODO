TODO

- v58 may well be stronger than v59, i.e. if it's the improved nav that's helping most.
- v59 may also send too few ships to a place, etc...

- Don't back off if our target is > 15 away

- In late rushes, might need to form up somehow
- Deal with rushes in 4 player...
- Make genetic algo disallow events where we have 0 ships and enemy has >= 1
- Intentional reckless (i.e. ramming) behaviour when a ship is low health
- 10 should be 11 in the ExecuteSafely() loop

ALTERNATE ALGORITHM...

- Ships which are trying to dock to things behave as before.
- All other ships are fighters and use a gradiant system...
