TODO (IMPORTANT)

- Try the 13 dist method in global GA.
- Use inhibition to decide how close to get to docked enemy ships.
- The decision to switch into rush needs to use enemy ships centre of gravity? Not general centre of gravity?
- Don't dock if incoming rush.
- Try collision avoidance by angle instead of slowdown.

VAGUE IDEAS

- Better bad-combat-avoidance (not based on own target??)
- Threat detection for planets based on.. what each ship's closest interesting planet is??
- Psyho Strategy: target docked ships only, falling back if needed.

TODO (SOMEWHAT)

-

OTHER

- Make genetic algo disallow events where we have 0 ships and enemy has >= 1
