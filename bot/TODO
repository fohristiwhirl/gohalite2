TODO (IMPORTANT)

- Try the 13 dist method in global GA.
- Use inhibition to decide how close to get to docked enemy ships.
- The decision to switch into rush needs to use enemy ships centre of gravity? Not general centre of gravity?
- Don't dock if incoming rush.
- Try collision avoidance by angle instead of slowdown.

- ewirkerman: "I tell them to retreat to someone who's safer than he is, and if they're safe, then advance, roughly speaking"
--- Try this:
----- Non-fleeing ships move first.
----- After that, fleeing ships go to their nearest non-fleeing ship, if possible.


- Or maybe:
--- Fleeing ships get a single attempt to retreat.
--- If blocked, they get frozen and all other ships nav around them.

VAGUE IDEAS

- Better bad-combat-avoidance (not based on own target??)
- Threat detection for planets based on.. what each ship's closest interesting planet is??
- Psyho Strategy: target docked ships only, falling back if needed.

TODO (SOMEWHAT)

-

OTHER

- Make genetic algo disallow events where we have 0 ships and enemy has >= 1
