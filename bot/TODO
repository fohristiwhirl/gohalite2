TODO (IMPORTANT)

- Leave the GA alone, mostly.

- Is there any reason why we use "imperfect" GA at longer distances?
- Maybe don't use GA when rushing until all ships have been close to an enemy.
--- Set a flag and *clear all targets* when we enter GA for the first time.
--- Or don't lock targets at all. Won't the RushProblems() fn work?

- Better bad-combat-avoidance (not based on own target??)
- Threat detection for planets based on.. what each ship's closest interesting planet is??
- Psyho Strategy: target docked ships only, falling back if needed.

TODO (SOMEWHAT)

- Maybe some form-up code when transitioning to rush in 1v1.

OTHER

- 10 should be 11 in the ExecuteSafely() loop
- Make genetic algo disallow events where we have 0 ships and enemy has >= 1
- There are some minor issues in the messaging system to do with e.g. SlowPlanDown() being called, followed by a a new course getting set due to deactivation of something.
